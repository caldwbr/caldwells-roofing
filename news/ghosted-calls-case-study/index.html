    <h1>Calls Going Straight to Voicemail? Our 5-Year Telecom Case Study <span class="badge">Lessons Learned</span></h1>
    <p>A nerdy post-mortem on “ghosted” calls, mis-provisioning, and finally fixing it in 2025.</p>
  </section>

    <section class="box">
      <strong>TL;DR:</strong> From 2020 to mid-2025, a hidden carrier-side issue made many inbound calls to our business line go <em>straight to voicemail</em>—but for a long stretch even voicemail was routed to an unused number, leaving no trace of the missed calls whatsoever. We initially didn’t realize it was telecom; we thought it was just a slow market. In summer 2025 we ported to Verizon and escalated until the line was fully re-provisioned. Calls immediately started ringing again like normal.
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Symptoms (What Customers Told Us)</h2>
      <ul class="list-compact">
        <li><strong>“It never rang—went straight to voicemail.”</strong></li>
        <li><strong>“I called and it rang then went to voicemail.”</strong></li>
        <li><strong>"Why did you call?"</strong> (Some company I had not called- spoofing by someone else).</li>
        <li>Long stretch of reroute of voicemail to unused number (I found the fake number they had routed it to).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why We Missed It for So Long</h2>
      <p>We didn’t initially suspect telecom. 2020–2021 brought market chaos, so a slower phone felt plausible. Also, a silent failure is sneaky: there’s no “missed call” count to clue you in. If analytics or routing treat your number poorly, calls can be diverted pre-ring or dropped before your handset ever sees them.</p>

      <h2>What Likely Happened (Nerd Mode)</h2>
      <p>Think of the call path as: <em>originating carrier → transit → terminating carrier (your provider) → features (forward/no-answer/voicemail) → handset</em>. If the terminating carrier has bad provisioning or a stale feature toggle, two ugly outcomes are common:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pre-ring diversion:</strong> The call is adjudicated (spam analytics, graylist, or mis-set conditional forwarding) and dropped to voicemail or another destination before the handset is invited to ring.</li>
        <li><strong>Dead routing:</strong> An old conditional route (e.g., CFNA/CFB) points to a retired number or mailbox. Call goes into a black hole; you get no log.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There’s also the <em>labeling/analytics</em> angle (STIR/SHAKEN, CNAM reputation, third-party scoring). If your number gets a bad reputation, some networks apply harsher call treatment. We submitted to industry registries and cleaned up any possible flags, but the ultimate fix came from forcing a clean, correct <strong>re-provision</strong> of the line.</p>

      <h2>Timeline (Condensed)</h2>
      <ul class="list-compact">
        <li><strong>2020–2024:</strong> Notice fewer inbound calls. Customers later report “straight to voicemail.” Multiple support contacts over the years did not produce a lasting fix.</li>
        <li><strong>2023:</strong> Separate headache: we lost control of our original domain (<em>caldwellsroofing.com</em>) after a third party acquired it via a registrar marketplace. We rebuilt the site at <em>caldwells-roofing.com</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Summer 2025:</strong> Ported the business line to Verizon and escalated until the number was fully and correctly provisioned post-port. Calls began ringing normally again. We also enrolled with the major caller registries for reputation hygiene.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Body Blows We Survived</h2>
      <ul class="list-compact">
        <li><strong>Domain loss (2023):</strong> In the middle of running jobs, I genuinely believed our long-held domain <code>caldwellsroofing.com</code> still had years left. I did not receive a renewal call from GoDaddy. When I checked, it was already gone and had been registered by someone else. Losing it wiped out years of SEO and links; we rebuilt at <a href="https://caldwells-roofing.com/">caldwells-roofing.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Change-order retaliation (2020):</strong> We issued a legitimate, documented change order and were punished to a scary degree for it—proof that subs are most exposed during change orders, which are infrequent but sometimes necessary.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Business Impact</h2>
      <p>With phones effectively “ghosting” many callers, new-lead volume and revenue cratered—roughly to a third of pre-2020 levels. Once calls began ringing normally in 2025, inbound interest rebounded immediately.</p>

      <h2>Quick Self-Audit for Any Small Business</h2>
      <div class="box">
        <ol class="list-compact">
          <li><strong>Test from outside your network:</strong> Call your main line from at least two different carriers (AT&T/Verizon/T-Mobile). Try during business hours and after hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Check conditional forwards:</strong> Ask your carrier to verify <code>CFU</code> (unconditional), <code>CFNA</code> (no-answer), and <code>CFB</code> (busy) are set correctly. Remove any legacy destinations.</li>
          <li><strong>Voicemail path:</strong> Confirm which mailbox the network is actually using and that it’s provisioned to your device/account.</li>
          <li><strong>Reputation hygiene:</strong> Register at the major caller registries (Free Caller Registry) and ensure your CNAM/name is accurate.</li>
          <li><strong>Escalate provisioning:</strong> If symptoms persist, request a <em>full reprovision</em> of your line or a “reset push” after any port or feature change.</li>
          <li><strong>Add a backstop:</strong> Put a secondary number (and a text button) on your site while troubleshooting. Most callers won’t try twice.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <h2>If You’re Reading This Because Your Phone Is Quiet…</h2>
      <p>Don’t wait. A quiet line might be a market lull—or it might be a silent technical failure. Verify the call path, fix the routing, and keep an alternate contact method visible. It’s the difference between a thriving calendar and empty weeks.</p>
