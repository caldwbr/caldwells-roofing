    <h1>Why We Use GAF Shingles Instead of Tamko, Owens Corning, CertainTeed, IKO, Atlas or Malarkey</h1>
    <p>If you’re researching roofing options in the Auburn–Opelika area, you’ve probably come across big shingle brand names like <strong>Tamko</strong>, <strong>Owens Corning</strong>, <strong>CertainTeed</strong>, <strong>IKO</strong>, <strong>Atlas</strong>, and <strong>Malarkey</strong>. At Caldwell’s Roofing, we install primarily <strong>GAF</strong> Timberline HDZ architectural shingles on our projects. Many homeowners ask why we recommend GAF shingles over those other brands. Below, we’ll explain the reasons we trust GAF for our clients’ roofs – from durability and curb appeal to algae resistance and warranty coverage – and how GAF compares to Tamko, Owens Corning, CertainTeed, IKO, Atlas, and Malarkey.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of GAF Shingles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Excellent Durability & Wind Performance:</strong> GAF shingles are engineered to withstand harsh weather. In fact, GAF’s Timberline HDZ is the only architectural shingle with an <em>unlimited</em> wind speed warranty for the first 15 years. When installed as a system with GAF accessories, Timberline HDZ shingles carry a 15-year WindProven™ warranty with no maximum wind speed limitation. By comparison, most other architectural shingles top out at 110 mph standard, or 130 mph with special installation.</li>
      <li><strong>Long-Lasting Appearance:</strong> GAF shingles tend to hold up better over time, so your roof keeps its fresh look longer. They maintain their protective granule coating well, which helps prevent premature bald spots or color loss. Combined with GAF’s algae protection (discussed next), this means a GAF roof in Auburn/Opelika will look better for more years before needing replacement.</li>
      <li><strong>Superior Algae Resistance:</strong> One common eyesore on aging roofs is black algae streaks, especially on north-facing slopes. GAF addresses this by including copper and zinc additives in their shingles (StainGuard Plus™ technology) that prevent algae growth. Timberline HDZ shingles come with a 25-year algae protection warranty – far longer than the 10- or 15-year algae resistance offered by many other brands. In other words, a GAF roof is much less likely to develop those ugly black stains, keeping your curb appeal high.</li>
      <li><strong>Industry-Leading Warranties:</strong> GAF offers some of the best warranty coverage in the industry. All GAF architectural shingles include a Lifetime limited warranty (with 10 years 100% coverage out of the box). However, when installed by a GAF factory-certified roofer like us, you can qualify for enhanced warranties that cover 50 years non-prorated on materials and up to 25 years on workmanship. For example, as a GAF Certified Contractor, Caldwell’s Roofing can provide the GAF System Plus or Golden Pledge warranties, giving you peace of mind that both the shingle and our installation are fully backed for decades.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tamko vs GAF Shingles</h2>
    <p><strong>Tamko</strong> is a well-known shingle manufacturer (popular for products like the Heritage series), but it’s often considered more of a “middle of the road” or builder-grade shingle brand by roofing professionals. In our experience, Tamko’s asphalt shingles don’t quite match GAF in long-term durability or protection. For instance, Tamko’s standard architectural shingle warranty has a 10-year full coverage period and a wind rating of 110 mph (130 mph with special installation). Its algae resistance warranty (on Tamko Heritage shingles) is only 10 years, the shortest algae warranty among major brands. By contrast, GAF provides a 25-year algae warranty on Timberline HDZ and can offer 15 years of unlimited wind coverage with the right installation. GAF’s overall warranty coverage also outpaces Tamko’s options.</p>

    <h2>Owens Corning vs GAF Shingles</h2>
    <p><strong>Owens Corning</strong> is another leading brand you may recognize (famous for their Duration® series and the pink panther mascot). Owens Corning makes excellent shingles as well, and in truth GAF and Owens Corning are both among the top shingle manufacturers in terms of quality and popularity. If you’re comparing Owens Corning vs. GAF, you’ll find a lot of similarities in their products – both offer lifetime warranties, similar pricing, and algae-resistant options.</p>
    <p>However, there are a few reasons we still stick with GAF. One is the unique WindProven™ unlimited wind warranty that GAF Timberline HDZ provides for 15 years – Owens Corning’s architectural shingles (like Oakridge® or Duration®) generally have a 110 mph wind warranty, upgradeable to 130 mph with extra steps, but nothing equivalent to GAF’s unlimited wind coverage. Another factor is algae protection: Owens Corning gives a 10-year algae resistance (“StreakGuard”) on most shingles, whereas GAF’s StainGuard Plus covers 25 years. This means a GAF roof will stay free of algae stains much longer than an Owens Corning roof under the same conditions.</p>

    <h2>CertainTeed vs GAF Shingles</h2>
    <p><strong>CertainTeed</strong> is often considered a premium shingle brand. Their Landmark® architectural shingles are highly regarded for heavyweight construction and durability. In fact, many roofing contractors praise CertainTeed’s quality – it’s not uncommon to hear that CertainTeed Landmark is one of the best shingles on the market. We agree that CertainTeed makes a great product. However, CertainTeed shingles typically come at a higher price point, and for many homeowners the difference isn’t noticeable compared to GAF.</p>
    <p>When we compare the specs, GAF Timberline HDZ holds its own against CertainTeed Landmark. Both have lifetime warranties and similar durability. GAF does have an edge in algae protection – Landmark’s algae warranty is 10 or 15 years (depending on the exact product), while GAF’s is 25 years for the equivalent shingle. GAF’s standard wind warranty (130 mph with six nails and starter) is comparable to CertainTeed’s, but again GAF offers the option of a 15-year unlimited wind speed warranty if installed as a system, which CertainTeed does not. In terms of selection, CertainTeed does offer more designer luxury shingle styles than GAF, but for the popular architectural category, both brands have attractive color choices and styles.</p>

    <h2>Atlas vs GAF Shingles</h2>
    <p><strong>Atlas</strong> Roofing shingles (such as the Pinnacle® Pristine line) have a strong reputation, especially for algae resistance. Atlas uses 3M™ Scotchgard™ technology in their shingles, and they offer a lifetime algae resistance warranty on certain products. This is a fantastic feature – it means Atlas roofs are very unlikely to get black streaks. Atlas shingles are also considered high quality and come with solid wind warranties (generally 120–130 mph) and decent non-prorated periods of 10–20 years.</p>
    <p>When comparing Atlas to GAF, there are a few differences. GAF’s 25-year algae warranty, while not “lifetime,” is still among the best in the industry. Most homeowners will replace or heavily renovate the roof by the 25+ year mark anyway, so in our view GAF’s algae protection is effectively on par with Atlas’s. In terms of wind performance, Atlas tops out around 130 mph (which is excellent), but GAF’s Timberline HDZ with the unlimited wind warranty for 15 years offers an extra level of confidence for storm-prone areas. We also find that GAF has a broader network of certified contractors and local supply in Alabama, which means easier access to materials and support.</p>

    <h2>IKO vs GAF Shingles</h2>
    <p><strong>IKO</strong> Cambridge and Dynasty shingles are common products. Over the years, IKO has aimed to improve its shingle quality, but the brand has had a mixed reputation. Many contractors (especially those in the U.S.) consider IKO to be a notch below the big names like GAF, Owens, and CertainTeed. Past consumer reports and lawsuits have documented problems with certain IKO shingle lines not holding up as well as expected.</p>
    <p>Because of these concerns, we generally avoid installing IKO unless a homeowner specifically requests it. GAF has proven to be more consistent in quality and warranty support. With GAF, we know we have the backing of North America’s largest roofing manufacturer and a robust warranty process if anything ever goes wrong. Simply put, choosing GAF over IKO is choosing a track record of reliability.</p>

    <h2>Malarkey vs GAF Shingles</h2>
    <p><strong>Malarkey</strong> shingles (like the Legacy® and Vista® series) use polymer-modified asphalt (SBS rubberized shingle technology), which can enhance durability and impact resistance. They also incorporate recycled materials and even “smog-reducing” granules for an environmental boost. In terms of performance, Malarkey shingles are considered top-tier – many roofers praise their durability and advanced features.</p>
    <p>The main drawbacks to Malarkey are cost and availability. Malarkey’s high-tech shingles tend to be more expensive than other brands’ comparable products. Additionally, Malarkey isn’t as widely distributed in our region; it can be harder to source their shingles in Alabama, and not all local crews are familiar with installing them (which could potentially increase labor costs). In short, Malarkey makes an excellent shingle, but the practical challenges mean it’s not always the best fit for a typical re-roof in Auburn or Opelika.</p>
