    <h1>Sagging or Falling Shingles</h1>
    <p>Seeing <strong>shingles sagging or falling off</strong> your roof? You’re not alone. In the Auburn–Opelika area, sun, storms, and (sometimes) sloppy installs can team up to loosen shingles. Here’s how to spot the problem, what usually causes it, and how we fix it right.</p>

    <h2>Quick Visual Clues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lifted/curling corners</strong> that won’t lie flat</li>
      <li><strong>Exposed nail heads</strong> or nails popping through shingles</li>
      <li><strong>Missing tabs</strong> or shingle pieces in the yard/gutter</li>
      <li><strong>Rows out of alignment</strong> (shingles slid down or look “wavy”)</li>
      <li><strong>Sagging dips in the roof line</strong> (possible soft/warped decking)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Shingles Sag or Fall (Top Causes)</h2>

    <h3>1) Overdriven Nails (Gun Pressure Too High)</h3>
    <p>If a nail is shot <em>through</em> the mat or sinks too deep, it won’t hold. That shingle is basically unsecured and can lift or blow off during wind. We calibrate nail guns (or hand-nail) so nails sit flush and bite the deck without cutting the shingle.</p>

    <h3>2) Nails Placed Too High (Above the Nailing Zone)</h3>
    <p>Each shingle has a proper nailing strip meant to pin the overlap. If nails are too high, they may miss the double-layer area entirely. Result: tabs lift, seals break, and shingles can peel back or slide. We nail exactly where the manufacturer specifies—every time.</p>

    <h3>3) Too Few Nails</h3>
    <p>Most architectural shingles want 4 nails, 6 in higher-wind installs. Under-nailing leaves corners loose and makes wind damage far more likely. We follow (and often exceed) spec based on your exposure.</p>

    <h3>4) Delamination (Unglued Tabs)</h3>
    <p>The adhesive strip must bond courses together. Dust, cold installs, moisture, or aging can keep tabs from sealing. Unsealed tabs catch wind and tear. We install in appropriate conditions, verify sealing, and hand-seal where needed.</p>

    <h3>5) Decking Deterioration or Warping</h3>
    <p>Shingles mirror the surface they sit on. Rotting/soft OSB or wavy plank decks cause “saggy” shingle lines and nail pops. Fix is replacing bad decking and ensuring proper attic ventilation so moisture doesn’t wreck the wood again.</p>

    <h3>6) General Age or Material Defects</h3>
    <p>Old, brittle shingles crack and lose adhesion. Occasionally a bad batch exists. If a roof is near end-of-life or has a widespread defect, targeted repairs help—but a planned replacement may be the smarter long-term move.</p>

    <h2>Installation Quality Is Everything</h2>
    <p>Most shingle failures we see aren’t “mysteries”—they’re installation errors. Correct nailing pattern and placement, solid decking, proper flashing, and clean sealing turn a roof into a 20+ year performer. We pair meticulous install technique with proven materials so you don’t watch shingles take flight every storm.</p>

    <h2>What To Do Next</h2>
    <p>If you’re seeing lifted tabs, exposed nails, or missing pieces, get a pro on the roof <em>before</em> water sneaks in. We’ll identify the root cause and give you a straightforward plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Spot-fix mis-nailed courses and hand-seal tabs</li>
      <li>Replace blown-off/compromised shingles</li>
      <li>Address soft/warped decking where necessary</li>
      <li>Advise if a full replacement is the better value</li>
    </ul>
