    <h1>Replacing Screws and Neoprene Washers on Classic Low-Rib Metal Roofs</h1>
      <p>The exposed fasteners of a classic low-rib metal roof often need replacement after 10+ years. We use special replacement screws (oversized) that are larger, longer, and that have larger neoprene seals/washers than typical original-installation screws. This helps to bite into the material with better pull-out resistance and to seal the hole that may have been widened by years of expansion/contraction of the metal panels.</p>
      <p>As you can see in the first image below, the exposed fasteners of classic-rib metal roofs degrade over time. The neoprene seal compresses, flattens, cracks, and can let a little water in, leading to rusting of the screw.</p>
