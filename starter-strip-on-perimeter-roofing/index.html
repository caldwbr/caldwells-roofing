            <h1>Starter Strip on Perimeter of Roofing</h1>
            <p>Every quality roofing system starts with a strong foundation. At Caldwell's Roofing, we understand that the first course of shingles and the perimeter of your roof are its most vulnerable points. That's why we use high-quality starter strips, like the **GAF ProStart® Starter Strip**, to ensure your roof is built to last.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Benefits of a Quality Starter Strip</h2>
            <p>A properly installed starter strip is not an optional extra—it's a critical component that provides crucial protection and a finished look for your entire roofing system. Here are the key benefits:</p>
            <h3>1. Unbeatable Wind Uplift Protection</h3>
            <p>The edges and corners of your roof are where wind can cause the most damage, leading to lifted or torn-off shingles. The GAF ProStart® starter strip features a strong adhesive sealant that securely glues down the very first row of shingles, creating a continuous bond. This drastically improves your roof's wind resistance, especially during severe Alabama storms.</p>
            <h3>2. Prevents Shingle Sagging for a Clean Finish</h3>
            <p>Without a proper starter strip, the first course of shingles can curl or droop over the drip edge, which not only looks unprofessional but also compromises the roof's integrity. The GAF ProStart® strip provides a straight, solid line for the shingles to be laid against, ensuring a clean, uniform perimeter that protects your roof and enhances its curb appeal.</p>
            <h3>3. Ensures Full Warranty Coverage</h3>
            <p>GAF, a leading manufacturer, requires the use of their starter strips as part of the GAF Lifetime Roofing System to qualify for enhanced warranties. By using a compatible starter strip, you can ensure your entire roof system is protected under a long-term manufacturer warranty.</p>
            <h3>4. Saves Time and Labor</h3>
            <p>Pre-cut starter strips are designed to fit the perimeter perfectly, saving our installers valuable time. Unlike cutting shingles on-site, using a dedicated starter strip is more efficient and provides a better, more consistent result.</p>

            <h2>Starter Strip FAQ</h2>
            <details><summary>What is the difference between a starter strip and a regular shingle?</summary>
                <p>A starter strip is a specially designed component with a factory-applied adhesive strip. It provides a clean, sealed edge and ensures the first row of shingles has a solid base. Cutting up regular shingles for the first row is not recommended as it lacks the adhesive sealant needed for proper wind protection.</p>
            </details>
            <details><summary>Is a starter strip really required?</summary>
                <p>Yes. A starter strip is a required component of a proper roofing system. Without it, your roof is more vulnerable to wind damage, and you may void the manufacturer’s warranty on the shingles.</p>
            </details>
            <details><summary>Does using a starter strip affect the cost of my new roof?</summary>
                <p>A starter strip is a standard, low-cost component included in every professional roof replacement quote. It adds very little to the overall price but provides significant long-term protection and value.</p>
