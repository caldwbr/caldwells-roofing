      <h1>Roof Cleaning &amp; Pressure Washing</h1>
      <p>Ugly black streaks, algae, moss, and general grime don’t mean your roof is “done.” In many cases, a careful cleaning can restore a lot of curb appeal and buy time before a replacement is needed. We also clean home exteriors and concrete (driveways, sidewalks, patios) for a full refresh.</p>

      <h2>What We Clean</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Asphalt shingles:</strong> black algae streaks, light moss, general dirt.</li>
        <li><strong>Metal roofs:</strong> pollen film, dirt, organic staining (avoid harsh abrasion).</li>
        <li><strong>Flat roofs (PVC/TPO/EPDM):</strong> pollen/dirt film, drain/scupper grime.</li>
        <li><strong>House exteriors:</strong> vinyl/painted siding, soffit/fascia, gutters (faces).</li>
        <li><strong>Concrete:</strong> driveways, sidewalks, porches, patios.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Clean Roofs (Safely)</h2>
      <p><strong>Warning about degranulation:</strong> Pressure washing can dislodge some granules off your shingles. This tradeoff may be worth it to improve appearance.</p>
      <p><strong>Honest trade-off:</strong> Any roof wash can cause a small amount of <em>degranulation</em> (some granules will release). Many shingle warranties caution against pressure washing for this reason. We’ll discuss the condition of your roof up front, the cleaning method we recommend, and whether the aesthetic benefit outweighs potential warranty concerns in your specific case.</p>
      <p><strong>Metal &amp; flat roofs:</strong> Typically respond well to low-pressure rinsing and appropriate cleaners, followed by a thorough fresh-water rinse. We avoid chemicals that could attack coatings or membranes.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>When Cleaning Makes Sense</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your roof is otherwise sound (no major leaks or widespread shingle failure).</li>
        <li>Black algae streaks are the main eyesore—common on north-facing slopes.</li>
        <li>You’re preparing to sell and want fast curb appeal.</li>
        <li>Ventilation and gutters are in good shape (we can also address those).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your shingles are brittle, losing a lot of granules already, or the roof is near end-of-life, we’ll recommend repair or replacement options instead of cleaning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>House &amp; Concrete Pressure Washing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>House exterior:</strong> siding, soffit/fascia, gutter faces, porch ceilings. We use sensible pressure levels and fan tips to avoid paint or siding damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Driveways &amp; sidewalks:</strong> circular head pressure washer and/or surface cleaners (if desired) to remove mildew, tire marks, and dirt evenly without zebra-striping.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Pricing &amp; Scheduling</h2>
      <p>Roof cleaning is quoted per job after a quick inspection (roof pitch, access, staining, and safety dictate time and materials). Exterior house washing and driveway/sidewalk cleaning are typically priced by square footage and complexity.</p>
