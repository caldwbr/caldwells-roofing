        <h1>Shingle Manufacturer Defects: Granule Loss on Dimensional Shingles</h1>
        <p>One particular failure pattern we're seeing involves streaks of granules coming off 15-year old roofs, but only on the bottom layer of two-layered dimensional shingles. This indicates a potential manufacturer defect rather than normal wear and tear.</p>
        
        <h2>Understanding the Defect Pattern</h2>
        <p>Modern dimensional (architectural) shingles are constructed with two or more layers laminated together. In this specific defect pattern, the bottom layer experiences premature granule loss in vertical streaks, while the top layer remains largely intact. This isn't normal weathering - it's a failure of the adhesive or material bonding between layers during manufacturing.</p>
        
        <p>When shingles are properly manufactured, granules should adhere evenly to both layers and wear uniformly over decades. When you see selective granule loss only on the bottom layer after just 15 years, it suggests:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Insufficient asphalt coating on the bottom layer during production</li>
          <li>Poor quality adhesive between the laminated layers</li>
          <li>Granules applied with inadequate pressure/adhesion to the bottom layer</li>
          <li>Material inconsistency between production batches</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Real-World Examples from 15-Year-Old Roofs</h2>
        <p>The images below show actual cases from our service area. Notice how the granule loss forms vertical streaks and only affects the bottom layer of each shingle:</p>

          </figure>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Why This Matters for Homeowners</h2>
        <p>Dimensional shingles typically carry 25-30 year warranties. Premature failure at 15 years means:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Your roof is deteriorating decades earlier than expected</li>
          <li>The exposed asphalt layer is vulnerable to UV degradation and leaks</li>
          <li>You may have a valid manufacturer warranty claim</li>
          <li>Roof replacement costs come much sooner than planned</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This specific pattern - vertical streaks affecting only the bottom layer - is a classic indicator of manufacturing defect rather than installation error or normal weathering.</p>

        <h2>What to Do If You Suspect This Defect</h2>
        <p>If your 12-18 year old dimensional shingle roof is showing this pattern:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Document it thoroughly:</strong> Take clear photos showing the vertical streaks and specific granule loss pattern</li>
          <li><strong>Check your records:</strong> Locate original roof installation paperwork and manufacturer warranty information</li>
          <li><strong>Contact us for inspection:</strong> We can professionally document the defect pattern and determine if it matches known manufacturer issues</li>
          <li><strong>Review warranty options:</strong> Many manufacturers have specific defect coverage that may apply even after the "prorated" period</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
          <li>Providing detailed inspection reports with photographic evidence</li>
          <li>Documenting the specific failure pattern that indicates manufacturing issues</li>
          <li>Assisting with warranty claim paperwork and manufacturer communications</li>
          <li>Offering repair or replacement options if warranty coverage is insufficient</li>
        </ul>
